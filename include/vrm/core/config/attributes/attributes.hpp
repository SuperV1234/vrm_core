/// @details Uses ` __attribute__`.
#define VRM_CORE_ATTRIBUTE(...) VRM_CORE_IMPL_ATTRIBUTE(__VA_ARGS__)

/// @macro Expands to the `always_inline` attribute.
/// @details Generally, functions are not inlined unless optimization is
/// specified. For functions declared inline, this attribute inlines the
/// function independent of any restrictions that otherwise apply to inlining.
/// Failure to inline such a function is diagnosed as an error. Note that if
/// such a function is called indirectly the compiler may or may not inline it
/// depending on optimization level and a failure to inline an indirect call may
/// or may not be diagnosed.
/// (From GCC documentation.)
#define VRM_CORE_ALWAYS_INLINE VRM_CORE_ATTRIBUTE(always_inline) inline

/// @macro Expands to the `noinline` attribute.
/// @details This function attribute prevents a function from being considered
/// for inlining. If the function does not have side-effects, there are
/// optimizations other than inlining that cause function calls to be optimized
/// away, although the function call is live.
/// (From GCC documentation.)
#define VRM_CORE_NEVER_INLINE VRM_CORE_ATTRIBUTE(noinline)

/// @macro Expands to the `pure` attribute.
/// @details Many functions have no effects except the return value and their
/// return value depends only on the parameters and/or global variables. Such a
/// function can be subject to common subexpression elimination and loop
/// optimization just as an arithmetic operator would be. These functions should
/// be declared with the attribute pure.
/// (From GCC documentation.)
#define VRM_CORE_PURE_FN VRM_CORE_ATTRIBUTE(pure)

/// @macro Expands to the `const` attribute.
/// @details Many functions do not examine any values except their arguments,
/// and have no effects except the return value. Basically this is just slightly
/// more strict class than the pure attribute below, since function is not
/// allowed to read global memory. Note that a function that has pointer
/// arguments and examines the data pointed to must not be declared const.
/// Likewise, a function that calls a non-const function usually must not be
/// const. It does not make sense for a const function to return void.
/// (From GCC documentation.)
